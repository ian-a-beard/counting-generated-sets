This counting algorithm provides a solution to exercise 1.4.1 in Enderton's Introduction to Mathematical Logic. 

Given a univerise U endowed with a unary operator g and a binary operator f, as well as a subset B = {a,b} of U, we have a construction for the set generated by B and the two operations. 

To do so, we consider length-n construction sequence. Let (x_1,...,x_n) be a construction sequence. 

Firstly, x_1 must be an element of B.

For i > 1 we must have one of the following:
1) x_i is an element of B
2) x_i = g(x_j) for some j < i
3) x_i = f(x_j,x_k) for some j,k < i

Given a construction sequence, we say that the last element of the sequence (here that is x_n) is the element it constructs.

Let C_n denote the constructible elements from length-n construction sequences.

Then the union of C_n for all positive integers n will form the set generated by B and the two operations.

The problem set forth by Enderton is combinatorial, as it asks us for some small values of n to determine the number of elements in C_n.

Even with the case of n = 3, counting by hand is an arduous process. Thus, this algorithm allows us to compute the possibilities much faster.
